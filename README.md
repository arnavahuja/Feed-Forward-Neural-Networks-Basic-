# Feed-Forward-Neural-Networks-Basic
This is a part of my learning experiences with deep learning.

Using high-level frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow or PyTorch allows us to build very complex models quickly. However, it is worth taking the time to look inside and understand underlying concepts. This contains the basic implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks using only numpy. 

It also contains the comparision between vectorised and non vectorised approach along with Overfitting and Regularization.
